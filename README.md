# Scaler NPS Ticket Analysis & KPI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **KPI dashboarding** for Scaler’s learner support and NPS (Net Promoter Score) ticketing data. The objective is to understand **learner pain points**, **support performance**, **resolution efficiency**, and **program-level trends** using Excel-based analytics and dashboards.

The dataset contains detailed information about support tickets raised by learners, including issue categories, program names, assigned handlers, resolution timelines, ticket status, and NPS ratings.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Analyze **overall ticket volume and resolution status**
* Identify **high-impact issue categories** affecting learner satisfaction
* Track **program-wise and handler-wise performance**
* Understand **NPS distribution** across issues and programs
* Highlight **operational bottlenecks** in support resolution

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Excel KPI Dashboard is divided into multiple analytical sections:

### 1️⃣ Overall Ticket Overview

* Total tickets raised vs resolved
* Status-wise distribution (Complete, Pending, In Progress)
* Ticket trends across time
* Resolution efficiency indicators

### 2️⃣ Program Overall Overview

* Ticket volume by program (DSML, DevOps, Academy, AIML, etc.)
* Program-wise NPS ratings
* Comparison of resolved vs pending tickets across programs
* Identification of programs with higher dissatisfaction

### 3️⃣ Issue Category Overall Overview

* Major issue categories such as:

  * Placement-related concerns
  * Program & classroom issues
  * Technical issues
  * TA support concerns
* Issue type frequency analysis
* NPS impact by issue category

### 4️⃣ Handler Overall Overview

* Tickets handled per support agent
* Resolution status by handler
* Comparison of closed vs pending tickets
* Identification of workload imbalance and performance gaps

### 5️⃣ Issue Type Overall Overview

* Sub-category analysis of issues
* Repeated learner concerns
* Issue types contributing to low NPS scores
